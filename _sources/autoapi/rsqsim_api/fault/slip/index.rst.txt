.. py:function:: fit_plane_to_points(points, eps = 1e-05)

   Find best-fit plane through a set of points, after first insuring the plane goes through
   the mean (centroid) of all the points in the array. This is probably better than my
   initial method, since the SVD is only over a 3x3 array (rather than the num_pointsxnum_points
   array).
   Returned values are:
       plane_normal:  Normal vector to plane (A, B, C)
       plane_origin:  Point on plane that may be considered as the plane origin


.. py:function:: convergence(dist)

   Linear between 49 mm/yr at -39 to 85 mm/yr at -27.5
