.. py:function:: read_binary(file, format, endian = 'little')

   Reads integer values from binary files that are output of RSQSim

   :param file: file to read
   :param format: either "d" (double) or "i" (integer)
   :param endian: usually "little" unless we end up running on a non-standard system
   :return:


.. py:function:: read_earthquakes(earthquake_file, get_patch = False, eq_start_index = None, eq_end_index = None, endian = 'little')

   Reads earthquakes, inferring list file names from prefix of earthquake file.
   Based on R scripts by Keith Richards-Dinger.

   :param earthquake_file: usually has a ".out" suffix
   :param get_patch:
   :param eq_start_index:
   :param eq_end_index:
   :param endian:
   :return:


.. py:function:: read_ts_coords(filename)

   This script reads in the tsurf (*.ts) files for the SCEC Community Fault Model (cfm)
   as a numpy array.
   The script is based on the matlab script ReadAndSaveCfm.m by Brendan Meade available
   from http://structure.rc.fas.harvard.edu/cfm/download/meade/ReadAndSaveCfm.m

.. py:function:: read_dxf(dxf_file)

   Reads mesh and boundary from dxf file exported from move. Returns boundary (as array) and triangles
