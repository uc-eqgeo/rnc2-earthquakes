# Install
The repository comprises example scripts that rely on three separate modules:
   1. tri_dislocations, for calculation of displacements.
   2. triangular_faults, a utility module to make use of tri_dislocations in the NZ context.
   3. rsqsim_api, which is designed to work with outputs from RSQSim.
   
At this stage, it is recommended that these modules are installed separately, because tri_dislocations especially can be slightly tricky
