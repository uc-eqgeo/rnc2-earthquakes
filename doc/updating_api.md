# Updating the RSQSim API

To start with, there will be numerous changes to the code, especially the API. To update the code, do the following.
1. Open the Anaconda terminal in the relevant environment (see *README.md* for details).
2. Navigate to the location where the code is stored.
3. Type `git fetch` and hit `Enter`.
4. Type `git pull` and hit `Enter`. A load of text describing file changes should appear.
5. Navigate into the `src` directory, e.g. by typing `cd src`
6. Re-install the rsqsim_api module by typing `pip install ./rsqsim_api`

Hopefully these steps will set you up with the latest version of the API code.
